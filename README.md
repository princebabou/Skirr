Skirr Blog ✨
Welcome to Skirr, the blog where I act like I’m an expert on everything tech, life, and random thoughts that probably only make sense to me. 🎉😂



Why Skirr? 🤔

Because, honestly, why not? 💁‍♂️ It’s 2024, and let’s face it, everyone and their grandma has a blog by now. So I figured, why not bless the internet with my profound wisdom and tech takes? Skirr is the corner of the web where I get to pretend I know what I’m talking about, and you get to pretend you’re reading something insightful. Win-win, right?



What’s Inside? 📦

Mind-blowing content: Okay, maybe not mind-blowing, but mildly interesting if you squint hard enough. 🤷‍♀️

Tech hot takes: Because I totally run the digital world... or at least, I like to think I do. 🔥

Built on Next.js: Like every other “modern” web project. Because who even codes in vanilla JS anymore? 😂

Responsive AF: Works flawlessly on your phone, tablet, or that smart fridge you convinced yourself you needed. Seriously, you can even browse it on a toaster if it has Wi-Fi. 📱💻

Deployed on Vercel: Because I believe in fast, smooth performance... and they give free hosting, so yeah. Check it out live here: skirr.vercel.app. Prepare to be mildly impressed.

Install (But like, only if you're bored) 💻



If for some reason you feel compelled to clone this masterpiece of a blog, here’s the easy-peasy command to do that:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skirr

cd skirr

npm install

npm run dev

Why? I don’t know, maybe you’re building your own blog or just feel like snooping around my code. Either way, no judgment.

or just simply visit it live at https://skirr.vercel.app

Contributions? 🛠️
LOL. I mean... sure, if you’re feeling generous and want to contribute to my sarcastic tech empire. Just open a PR, but please, make sure your vibes match the level of sass this blog radiates. Otherwise, it’ll get the boot. 😉
